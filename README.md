i made this project as a part of bin @ hack club but by the time i was done with fixing its quirks and ready to submit the wokwi link, the <b>esp32 had been removed</b> from the list of parts approved for the bin (since it was getting too expensive i think). the microcontroller played the very essential role in this project since there weren't many other parts in this aside from it and the multple LEDs that was to be sourced locally (since bin only ships one (1) quantity of each part used in the project).
